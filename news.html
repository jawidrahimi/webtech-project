                    <p> The OLAC News Page serves as a hub for updates and announcements related to the OLAC (Open
                        Language Archives Community). It provides information about recent developments, events, and
                        activities within the language archiving community. The page keeps users informed about new
                        features, tools, and initiatives, as well as any important changes or collaborations. It is an
                        essential resource for staying updated on the ongoing work of OLAC and its partners in the field
                        of language documentation and archiving.</p>

                    <p>
                        The OLAC system has now been integrated with the Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud.
                        <i>Linked Data</i> is "a recommended best practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces
                        of data, information, and knowledge on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF." This opens the way
                        for the contents of OLAC's 60 participating archives to be interlinked and queried.

                        As a service to linguists who are in search of an archive that could receive a deposit of
                        language resources they have created, this page lists all of the OLAC participants who have
                        published their submission policy as part of their OLAC repository.

                    <p>
                        In December 2010, to mark our 10th anniversary, OLAC announces a new search service.
                        Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and hosted by the University of Pennsylvania
                        Libraries, the service provides powerful search over the combined catalog of all resources
                        from all participating archives. It is based on the "faceted search" strategy,
                        in which search results are successively narrowed by
                        clicking on available values of standardized descriptors like language, language family,
                        country, linguistic subfield, data type, format, and more. Click on "Search Strategies"
                        in the upper left panel for basic documentation:

                    <p>
                        In January 2008, the DRIVER project (Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European
                        Research)
                        convened a Summit to present results of its initial test-bed
                        phase and to pave the way for establishing an operational confederation of digital repositories.
                        DRIVER responds to the vision that all relevant scientific content should be easily accessible
                        through internet-based infrastructures.
                        Like OLAC, DRIVER builds on the OAI (Open Archives Initiative)
                        infrastructure.
                        OLAC was invited to present its work on developing a
                        "thematic" federation of repositories focused on language
                        resources.
